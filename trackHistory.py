'''
   An updated history handling system. Instead of having a single file 
   that indicates when we first added something from an album, we'll instead 
   track the history of individual files -- helpful for something like TMBG's 
   2015 Dial a song project, where they release a new track each week that we 
   treat as all being part of the same album. 

   We'll keep track of each MP3 file as it's added to a directory, using a data structure 
   that's a dict of file names mapping to a list of timestamps (we'll continue using 
   int(time.time())). The history class can then grow some useful functionality like returning 
   a list of files that were put there within a certain number of days (see recent.py, for 
   code that maintains a set of MPD playlist files that are time)
   
   The list of timestamps for each file will be [date_acquired, date_copied_here] -- in most
   cases, I expect that date acquired is going to be the interesting one, but who knows. When 
   we copy/move files, that timestamp will be copied into the same index in the new history 
   file in the new directory, but the second one will reflect the date/time the file was 
   moved/copied.
