## MP3 Utilities

A bunch of small Python utilities that I use to maintain my music collection. I doubt that these are in any way directly usable by anyone else directly as is, or are actually interesting to anyone. 

These run locally on my MacBook Pro running 10.7.5 and my jukebox machine that's running Ubuntu 12-something.

### Dependencies

- Python, obviously. I'm using 2.6 locally. 
- LAME - http://lame.sourceforge.net/ -- the `mover.py` utility has an option to copy files, and you can transcode to a different bitrate if LAME is available. 
- mutagen - http://code.google.com/p/mutagen/ Python library for working with metadata tagging

### Files

#### `dirlist.py`

#### `echonest.py`
