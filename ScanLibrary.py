'''   
   ScanLibrary -- utility to traverse a collection of MP3 files in our layout
   and collect data to save in a JSON file with useful details.

   We read and write the results as JSON text files, and manipulate them 
   internally as plain old dicts that reflect the hierarchy of 
   Artist
      album
         track 1
            track details
         track 2
            track details
      album 2
         track 1
            track details

   Anything that we need to store inside these dicts that's for our internal use
   should be named with two leading underscores (and by the same token, we need to 
      disallow naming artists, albums, or tracks with that convention to avoid them 
      disappearing)
