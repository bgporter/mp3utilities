   Assumes a few things:

   1. We're using MPD (we are!)
   2. We have MP3 files in a tree where the leaf directories containing
      music also contain a file named YYYY_Album-Name.history that's 
      plain text and the first line of that file is a string/integer that's
      the int(time.time()) of when that directory was first moved into our
      system 
   3. We want to create a set of playlists that each contain all the files that 
      were acquired in the last (e.g.) Month, Quarter, Year.

   Docs on the requirements of the MPD playlist format are at
   http://mpd.wikia.com/wiki/Playlists

   2015/07/12: Rewritten to use the newer fileSource.FileSource object
   to handle walking the directories for us and the newer trackHistory.history 
   class that lets us track acruisition/move dates on a per-track basis instead
   of a per-directory basis.
